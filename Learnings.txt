This project involved building a dynamic library management application to practice object-oriented programming concepts. Initially, I used a manual approach to create and display books. As I progressed, I transitioned to an object constructor and prototype-based approach, which enhanced the modularity, scalability, and efficiency of the code. The project not only deepened my understanding of constructors and prototypes but also helped me implement dynamic DOM manipulation and synchronization techniques to create an interactive and responsive UI.

**Learnings from the Project:**

1. **Object Constructors:**
   - Understood how to use constructors to create reusable blueprints for objects.
   - Replaced a manual object creation approach with a constructor-based approach for consistency and scalability.

2. **Prototypes:**
   - Learned to define shared methods for objects using prototypes.
   - Implemented a prototype method (`readToggle`) to toggle the `read` status of a book.

3. **DOM Manipulation:**
   - Explored how to dynamically create and update DOM elements to display the library and reflect changes in the array.
   - Learned to update specific elements in the DOM after making changes to the underlying data.

4. **Data and DOM Synchronization:**
   - Ensured synchronization between the `myLibrary` array and the DOM by coupling object manipulations with DOM updates.
   - Addressed challenges of maintaining this link efficiently.

5. **Event Listeners:**
   - Attached event listeners dynamically to buttons for functionalities like removing a book and toggling the `read` status.
   - Managed events efficiently by linking buttons to specific objects using indices and classes.

6. **Unique Identifiers:**
   - Considered the importance of unique identifiers to avoid issues with shifting indices after array modifications.

7. **Looping Through DOM Elements:**
   - Implemented loops to dynamically traverse and manipulate DOM elements for reassigning IDs or updating specific parts of the UI.

## **Future Improvements**

1. Use unique identifiers for books instead of array indices to handle data-UI synchronization more robustly.
2. Refactor repetitive DOM manipulation logic into modular functions.
3. Add form validation to prevent invalid inputs.
4. Enhance the UI with animations or additional styling.
